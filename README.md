# Fall-Detection-Using-CV
This project uses a combination of computer vision techniques, including the YOLOv5 object detection model and Mediapipe pose estimation, to detect falls in real-time. The system analyzes video feeds from a webcam or video file to identify people, estimate their posture, and detect potential falls. Upon detecting a fall, it triggers an alert sound to notify caregivers or monitoring personnel.
